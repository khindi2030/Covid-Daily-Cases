# Covid-Daily-Cases
Collect Data Information about daily Covid Cases, using API, and save it in SQLite
the data on new cases of people with covid. The dataset is available on https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/provincial-daily-totals
We want to recover the data and store it in an SQLITE table using Python Programming Language.
Develop the python code necessary to insert into the “CASCOVID” table the data corresponding to the following attributes:
   "Daily Active, Daily Cases, Daily Deaths, Daily Hospitalized, Daily ICU, Daily Recovered, Daily Tested, Date, Province, Total Active, Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Hospitalized, Total ICU"
Provide the function which allows to list the contents of the table. Can we get a list according to a date interval? Give an example.
Once the data has been retrieved, put the data in a dataframe and provide a description of the corresponding pandas dataframe (shape, head)
